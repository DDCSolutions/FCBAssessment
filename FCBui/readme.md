# First Citizens Bank Code Assessment

This solution was developed with **Visual Studio 2022 Community edition**. The solution name is FCB Assessment. 

For the front end, it’s **Angular 16** and the server side is **.NET 7.0**. I used the **Angular CLI** to generate the components and services. I chose to persist the data to a temp file as JSON. I was originally going to use SQLIte as the database but ran out of time.

I typically use the **Angular Material** for styling but for simplicity sake and code readability left it out. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for any questions you may have. Thank you for giving me the opportunity code for you on this assessment. I enjoyed putting it together.
